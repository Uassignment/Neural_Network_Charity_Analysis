# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this project is to analyze data for Alphabet Soup using machine learning and neural networks to predict where to make investments

# Results: 

o	Data Preprocessing

* The column IS_SUCCESSFUL is considered target because it contained binary data measuring the effectivity of the donation

* The following columns APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT are the features for our model.

* The columns EIN and NAME are identification information and have been removed from the input data.


o	Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* This deep-learning neural network model is made of two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons respectively.

* This deep-learning neural network model is made of two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons respectively.
  The input data has 43 features and 25,724 samples.

* The model accuracy is 73%. The model didn't achieve the target performance of 75% or better. This is not a satisfactory result further work require to make the model reliable.
